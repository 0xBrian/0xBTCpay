%a#_0xbitcoin(href="https://0xbitcoin.org/")
  %img(src="/0xbitcoin.svg")
%p
  Now your web store can accept payment in 0xBitcoin (0xBTC).
%p
  It's free.
  %strong 0xBTCpay does not charge any fees.
  You run your own instance of 0xBTCpay.
%p
  You can use your existing server or rent a server at companies like
  <a href="https://digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> and
  <a href="https://linode.com/">Linode</a>.
%h2 What does 0xBTCPay do?
%p
  0xBTCpay is a bridge between the Ethereum network and traditional web stores.
%p
  0xBTCpay enables web stores to handle 0xBitcoin payments with simple web
  calls, rather than having to understand Ethereum, similar to the way web
  stores process credit cards already.
%h2 How does it work?
%p
  When your customer wants to pay with 0xBitcoin, your web store passes the
  customer to your 0xBTCpay instance to handle the payment.  0xBTCpay monitors
  the customer's 0xBitcoin transaction, and tells your web store when the
  payment is complete. Then your web store can finish processing the order as
  usual.
